# Kanban Board Comparison: Proving "React-by-Default" Has Real Costs

This repository is a **follow-up proof of concept** to the blog post ["React Won by Default ‚Äì And It's Killing Frontend Innovation"](link-to-post).

That post argued React's dominance stifles innovation. This repo **proves it with data**.

By building the same real-world Kanban app across **5 framework implementations**, we measure the actual costs of "React-by-default":

1. ‚úÖ **Next.js 15** (standard) - Virtual DOM baseline
2. ‚úÖ **Next.js 15 + React Compiler** - Can optimization close the gap?
3. ‚úÖ **SolidStart** - Fine-grained reactivity (signals)
4. ‚úÖ **SvelteKit** - Compiler-first approach (Svelte 5 runes)
5. üöß **Qwik City** - Resumability (no hydration)

All apps share the same SQLite database, features, and UI. **Identical functionality, measurable differences.**

## Tech Stack Comparison

| Category | Next.js | SolidStart | SvelteKit | Qwik |
|----------|---------|------------|-----------|------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 15 (App Router) | SolidStart 1.0 | SvelteKit + Svelte 5 | Qwik City |
| **UI Library** | React 19 | SolidJS 1.9 | Svelte 5 | Qwik |
| **Reactivity Model** | Virtual DOM | Signals (fine-grained) | Runes (compile-time) | Signals + Resumability |
| **Data Fetching** | Server Components | `createAsync` with cache | `load` functions | `routeLoader$` |
| **Mutations** | Server Actions | Server functions | Form actions | Server actions |
| **Database** | Drizzle ORM + better-sqlite3 | Drizzle ORM + better-sqlite3 | Drizzle ORM + better-sqlite3 | Drizzle ORM + better-sqlite3 |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS v3 + DaisyUI | Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI | Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI | Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI |
| **Drag & Drop** | @dnd-kit/core, @dnd-kit/sortable | @thisbeyond/solid-dnd | svelte-dnd-action | TBD |
| **Build Tool** | Turbopack | Vinxi | Vite | Vite + Qwik optimizer |

## Bundle Size Comparison

**Production builds (gzipped):**

| Framework | Homepage | Board Page | Status |
|-----------|----------|------------|--------|
| **Next.js** | ~122 kB | ~148 kB | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Next.js + Compiler** | ~123 kB | ~153 kB | ‚úÖ Complete
| **Nuxt** | ~132kb | ~139kb | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Analog** | ~XXkb | ~XXkb | ‚ö†Ô∏è Planned |
| **SolidStart** | ~30 kB | ~40 kB | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **SvelteKit** | ~24 kB | ~40 kB | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Qwik City** | ~45kb | ~61kb | ‚úÖ Complete |


**Key Takeaway**: Both SolidStart and SvelteKit are **3-4x smaller** than Next.js. Compile-time optimization (Svelte) and fine-grained reactivity (Solid) both eliminate Virtual DOM overhead.

**Pattern Confirmed**: Rethinking core assumptions (Virtual DOM, hydration) yields **3-4x bundle size improvements**, not incremental gains.

**Why This Matters**: For teams serving mobile professionals (real estate agents, field workers, healthcare staff) on cellular connections, 108 kB = 1.5-2 seconds on 4G. That's the difference between confident and apologetic when a buyer is watching.

## Performance Metrics of Board Page (run locally)

| Metric | Next.js | Next.js + Compiler | SolidStart | SvelteKit | Qwik |
|--------|---------|-------------------|------------|-----------|------|
| Lighthouse Performance | 98% | 98% | 100% | 99% | TBD |
| First Contentful Paint | 18ms | 17ms | 59ms | 7ms | TBD |
| Largest Contentful Paint | 8ms | 9ms | 6ms | 6ms | TBD |
| Interaction to Next Paint | 24-40ms | 24-40ms | 24-40ms | 24-40ms | TBD |

**Key Takeaway**: All are fast in optimal conditions, but smaller bundles win on cellular networks where every KB matters.

## Architecture Differences

### Next.js 15
- **Server Components**: Pages are Server Components by default, fetching data at the server level
- **Client Components**: Interactive UI (modals, drag-drop) uses `"use client"` directive
- **Server Actions**: Form submissions and mutations use async server functions
- **Optimistic Updates**: Managed via React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- **Cache Invalidation**: `revalidatePath()` clears Next.js cache after mutations

### SolidStart
- **Fine-grained Reactivity**: Signals and effects provide granular updates without re-rendering
- **Server Functions**: `"use server"` directive for server-side logic
- **Cache Integration**: `cache()` and `revalidate()` for data freshness
- **Optimistic Updates**: Managed via SolidJS stores and signals
- **Native Drag-and-Drop**: Uses `@thisbeyond/solid-dnd` library

### SvelteKit
- **Runes**: Svelte 5's compile-time reactivity (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`)
- **Load Functions**: Server-side data loading per route with automatic caching
- **Form Actions**: Progressive enhancement for form submissions with `enhance`
- **Compiler-First**: Minimal runtime overhead‚Äîmost framework code compiled away
- **Optimistic Updates**: Managed via `$state` runes with automatic reactivity
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Uses `svelte-dnd-action` library with built-in FLIP animations

### Qwik City (Coming Soon)
- **Resumability**: No hydration‚Äîresume execution instantly
- **Progressive Loading**: Load only what's needed for current interaction
- **Fine-grained Lazy Loading**: Component-level code splitting
- **Signals**: Fine-grained reactivity without Virtual DOM

## Complexity Comparison

**SolidStart is conceptually simpler than Next.js**, despite being less familiar to React developers.

### Next.js Complexity

**Structural and Conceptual Overhead:**
- **Server/Client Split**: Must constantly think about component boundaries and where code can run
- **More Files**: Common pattern of `page.tsx` (Server Component) + `PageClient.tsx` (Client Component) creates file overhead
- **React's Rules of Hooks**:
  - Can't call hooks conditionally or in loops
  - Must maintain hook call order
  - Easy to violate, causes runtime errors
- **Dependency Arrays**:
  - `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` require manual dependency tracking
  - Easy to get wrong, causes stale closures and infinite loops
  - Need ESLint plugin to catch mistakes
- **Re-render Optimization**:
  - Must use `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders
  - Performance requires understanding Virtual DOM reconciliation
  - Note: React 19's experimental compiler can auto-optimize, but it's opt-in and not enabled in this app
- **Drag-and-Drop Setup**: `@dnd-kit` requires manual sensor configuration, collision detection, and context providers

**Code Statistics:**
- ~17 total components
- 11 Client Components (`"use client"`)
- 6 Server Components (pages, layouts)
- More boilerplate for state and effects

### SolidStart Complexity

**Simpler Mental Model:**
- **Fine-grained Reactivity**:
  - Signals are just getter/setter pairs: `count()` reads, `setCount(5)` writes
  - More explicit than `useState` (clear distinction between read/write)
  - No dependency arrays‚Äîreactivity is automatic
- **No Rules of Hooks**:
  - Call signals anywhere: loops, conditionals, callbacks, event handlers
  - No ordering constraints
  - Less to remember, fewer gotchas
- **Automatic Dependency Tracking**:
  - Use a signal in JSX or an effect, it automatically subscribes
  - **Less** cognitive load‚Äîdon't think about dependencies
  - Compiler handles the complexity
- **No Re-render Optimization Needed**:
  - Fine-grained updates mean only affected DOM nodes update
  - No `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `React.memo` needed
  - Performance is the default
- **Cache/Revalidate**:
  - `createAsync` with `cache()` and `revalidate()` is explicit and clear
  - Simpler than Next.js's invisible cache + `revalidatePath()`

**Code Statistics:**
- ~17 total components (same count as Next.js)
- All components can use reactivity without directives
- Significantly less boilerplate (no dependency arrays, no optimization hooks)

### Verdict

**For React developers**: SolidStart has a **learning curve** (new syntax, different mental model), but is **conceptually simpler** once learned. No rules of hooks, no dependency arrays, no re-render optimization.

**For new developers**: SolidStart is objectively simpler. Fewer rules, less boilerplate, more predictable behavior.

**In practice**: SolidStart requires ~20-30% less code for the same functionality due to automatic reactivity and no optimization boilerplate. The hardest part is unlearning React's constraints.

### SvelteKit Complexity

**Even Simpler Than SolidStart:**
- **Svelte 5 Runes**:
  - `let count = $state(0)` - reactive state is just a variable
  - `let doubled = $derived(count * 2)` - computed values are explicit
  - No getters/setters like Solid‚Äîreads and writes look like normal variables
- **No Rules, No Manual Tracking**:
  - Use state anywhere: loops, conditionals, event handlers
  - Automatic dependency tracking in `$effect` and `$derived`
  - No dependency arrays, no rules of hooks
- **Template Syntax**:
  - Write HTML with `{expressions}` directly in `.svelte` files
  - `#if`, `#each`, `#await` for control flow (clear and declarative)
  - Scoped styles by default (no CSS-in-JS needed)
- **Progressive Enhancement**:
  - Forms work without JavaScript by default
  - `use:enhance` progressively enhances with client-side optimistic updates
  - Best of both worlds: works everywhere, fast when JS available
- **Zero Optimization Needed**:
  - Compiler analyzes code at build time
  - Only subscribes to what's actually used
  - No manual memoization, no performance tuning

**Code Statistics:**
- ~17 total components (same as Next.js and SolidStart)
- All components can use reactivity without directives
- Least boilerplate of all three frameworks
- Most "normal" looking code (closest to vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)

**Verdict**: SvelteKit is the **most approachable** for developers coming from any background. It feels like writing enhanced HTML/CSS/JS, not learning a new programming paradigm. Once you understand runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`), everything else is just HTML and JavaScript.

## Why This Comparison Matters

This isn't just about bundle sizes. It's about:

1. **Proving a thesis**: "React-by-default" has measurable costs
2. **Empowering choice**: When you see the data, you can make informed decisions
3. **Mobile-first reality**: For teams without native apps, web performance IS the product
4. **Innovation space**: Alternatives deserve evaluation on technical merit, not just network effects

**The pattern we're testing**: When you rethink fundamental assumptions (Virtual DOM, hydration, reactivity), you get fundamentally better results. Not 10% better. 3-4x better.

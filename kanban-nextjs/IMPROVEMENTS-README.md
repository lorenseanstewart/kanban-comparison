## 🧪 Testing the Improvements

### Visual Tests
1. Navigate to home page → Should see skeleton while loading
2. Click on a board → Should see board skeleton while loading
3. Try invalid board URL → Should see custom 404 page
4. Check browser tab → Should show dynamic board titles

### Functional Tests
1. Create a new board → Should work smoothly
2. Create a new card → Should work smoothly
3. Drag and drop cards → Should work correctly
4. Edit a card → Changes should persist
5. Delete a card → Should be removed

### Performance Tests
1. Check Network tab → No unnecessary API calls
2. Check font loading → No FOUT (flash of unstyled text)
3. Check loading states → Smooth transitions
4. Concurrent operations → No race conditions

---

## 📱 Key Improvements Explained

### Before 
```typescript
// ❌ Transaction not awaited - potential race condition
db.transaction((tx) => {
  tx.update(cards).set({...}).run();
});

// ❌ Manual API routes for mutations
fetch('/api/cards/move', { 
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({...})
});

// ❌ No loading states - blank screens
// ❌ Generic 404 pages
// ❌ Static metadata - bad for SEO
```

### After
```typescript
// ✅ Transaction properly awaited
await db.transaction((tx) => {
  tx.update(cards).set({...}).run();
});

// ✅ Direct Server Action calls
import { updateCardList } from "@/lib/actions";
await updateCardList(cardId, targetListId);

// ✅ Automatic loading states via loading.tsx
// ✅ Custom 404 pages with helpful UI
// ✅ Dynamic metadata for better SEO
```

## Political and Economic Consequences

[] there are real consequences for how we build our apps.

[] the web is the mobile web, and if your app is accessible on the web people will try to use it on their mobile browsers

[] by building bloated apps that don’t work on mobile, we motivate people to exit the free web and enter the walled gardens of app stores

[] then we exit market competition and enter the techno-feudalistic system of platforms (quote the book)

[] in techno-feudalism, market competition is replaced by pure extraction. the apps, the vassals, can compete among one another, but the only real winner is the feudal lord (the platform)

[] this is not capitalism. it’s something worse; something designed for extraction without any form of contribution. platforms like app stores do nothing productive, they only extract.
